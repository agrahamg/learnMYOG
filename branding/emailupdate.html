Hi friends,
With knowledge gained designing several hoodies over the past year, I've revisited and completely redesigned the UL Windshell to layer perfectly with the Alpha Raglan Hoodie. 

<img src="https://learnmyog.com/images/windshell2/coverart.jpg" title="UL Windshell" style="width:100%">

The completely new pattern and instructions now include:
<ul>
    <li>Expanded sizing from XXS to XXL and improved sleeve fit</li>
    <li>Hood redesign for better fit, brim stiffener, and optional hood cinch</li>
    <li>Secure zipper pockets with cleaner finish and easier construction</li>
    <li>Revamped instructions with detailed photos of nearly every step</li>
    <li>Illustrated fit adjustments and cut layout</li>
    <li>Multiple paper size patterns including print-at-home and large formats</li>
</ul>
I'm stoked you tried out the Beta Series UL Windshell and hope you enjoy this FREE update to the pattern!
