      Tips for curves, step 8 and 9

      1. Wrong sides out, pin your panels aligning seam marks, and begin to sew perimeter.
      1. Take your time, sewing tight curves gets easier with patience and pract
      1. Tip: I find it helpful to start stitching along the top and bottom seam marks so any bunching happens in the corners or along shorter sides.
      1. Tip: Shorten your stitch length around the curves.

        alt="Fanny pack flipped right side out thru top zipper."
      />

      1. Flip your fanny pack right side out through the top zipper.
      1. Closely inspect and correct any mistakes or misalignment with a seam ripper. No shame!
      1. Depending on your fabric choices, stop seam fray by edge binding or fuse with a Bic lighter.
      1. Finish off by installing hardware and install cord pulls to silence jingly bits.
