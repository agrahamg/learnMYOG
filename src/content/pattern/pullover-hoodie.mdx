    ### Pullover Hoodie Pattern

    - Classic pullover design with slimmer fit and modern well-fitting hood
    - Clean front with huge front kangaroo pocket with side gussets
    - Deep snap placket for ease of wear and extra heat management

    ### Sewing Skill Level

    While a beginner can make this project, familiarity with sewing terms and construction techniques is required.
    For best results sewing knits or high pile fleece, a serger or domestic machine with satin (zig zag) stitch is
    necessary.
    Grading between sizes and/or pattern adjustments may be required for perfect fit.
