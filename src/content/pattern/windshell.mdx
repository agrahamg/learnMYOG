    ### Sewing Skill Level - Advanced Beginner

    While a beginner can make this project, familiarity with sewing terms and construction techniques is expected. For
    best results, a serger is recommended. A zig zag or overlock stitch will work but results may vary based on individual
    skill. This is a great beginner garment pattern with technical ultralight woven fabrics. Make a prototype and have
    fun!

    ### Body Measurements and Fit Guide

    Detailed instructions on getting a great fit are included. Sizing covers wide range of chest sizes measuring 32 inches
    up to 52 inches corresponding to RTW sizing XXS to XXL. Custom fit adjustments are illustrated within the
    instructions. In the photos, I'm (6'0" tall, 170 lbs, 39" chest) wearing a size medium. See pattern preview photo in
    gallery above for finished garment sizes.

  | Body Measurement (inches) | 32 (XXS) | 34    | 36    | 40    | 44    | 48    | 52 (XXL) |
  |---------------------------|----------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|----------|
  | Chest (Upper Bust)        | 30-32    | 33-34 | 35-37 | 38-40 | 41-44 | 45-48 | 49-52    |
  | Natural Waist             | 24-26    | 26-27 | 28-30 | 32-34 | 36-38 | 40-42 | 44-46    |

    [RipstopByTheRoll](https://ripstopbytheroll.com/?rfsn=4608557.2d546b9) is my preferred shop for ultralight breathable
    fabrics with DWR that are perfect for the UL Windshell. For the most breathable windshell, look for uncalendered
    fabric such as 1.0oz HyperD. Higher denier, higher weight per yard fabrics will be noticeably more durable and easier
    to sew. For example, 1.6oz HyperD vs 1.0oz HyperD.

    A few excellent recommendations:

    - [HyperD](https://ripstopbytheroll.com/collections/hyperd?rfsn=4608557.2d546b9) is uncalendered for maximum
    breathability, won't feel clammy, and has good sewability.
    - [MEMBRANE](https://ripstopbytheroll.com/collections/membrane?rfsn=4608557.2d546b9) fabrics are incredibly
    lightweight and buttery smooth to touch, but not beginner-friendly.
    - [1.1oz Ripstop Nylon](https://ripstopbytheroll.com/products/1-1-oz-ripstop-nylon?rfsn=4608557.2d546b9) or Ripstop
    Polyester (OutdoorINK) are budget and beginner-friendly.
    - [MONOLITE mesh](https://ripstopbytheroll.com/products/1-0-oz-monolite-ripstop-nylon-mesh?rfsn=4608557.2d546b9) is
    the lightest and most durable pocket liner option I've found.
