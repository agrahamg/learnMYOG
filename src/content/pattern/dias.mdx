  <DividedSection header="Design Features">
    First released in 1982, Patagonia¬Æ Baggies‚Ñ¢ have been a summer staple for 40 years.
    Inspired by the classics, but with a modern shake, let DIAS be your next make. ü§ô

    - Classic style outdoor shorts with regular rise and casual straight fit
    - Full length crotch gusset for range of motion and squat comfort
    - Deep hand pockets that won't flip out with an inner iPhone pocket
    - One or two back pockets with or without a secure snap flap
    - Drawcord and elastic waistband constructed to allow for future replacement

    ### Garment Fit

    DIAS are designed with a casual straight fit and standard rise. Compared to Patagonia¬Æ Baggies‚Ñ¢, DIAS are slightly less
    baggy around the hips and thigh for a more trim shape. Referencing the photo gallery, I'm 6'0" tall, 170 lbs, 39"
    full-hip and wearing a size 40. I typically wear a men's medium. While a 5" inseam is standard, easily extend or short
    with included illustrated instructions for inseam and rise fit.

    ### Body Measurements

    The sewing pattern covers a wide range of sizes corresponding to XS to XXL. Full hip/seat is the main sizing
    measurement, the maximum horizontal circumference around hips and butt.

  | Body Measurement (inches) | 32-34 | 35-37 | 38-40 | 41-43 | 44-46 | 47-49 |
  |---------------------------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
  | Full Hip (Seat)           | 32-34 | 35-37 | 38-40 | 41-43 | 44-46 | 47-49 |
  | Pant-Waist                | 28-29 | 30-32 | 33-35 | 36-38 | 40-43 | 45-47 |
  | Mid Thigh                 | 18.5  | 19.5  | 20.5  | 22.5  | 24.5  | 26.5  |

    ### Sewing Skill Level - Confident Beginner

    DIAS have been designed for confident beginners. Apparel can be intimidating so this base pattern is low complexity and
    uses modest materials. An optional welt pocket on the back of the shorts is provided for intermediate sewers and a
    household steam iron is recommended. While a beginner can make this project, familiarity with sewing and basic
    construction techniques is expected. Serging simplifies construction however an overcast stitch, french seams, or flat
    felled seams are alternative methods to finish raw edges.

    Suggested needle and thread pairing for this project is:

    - ü™° Universal or Microtex 80/12 needles
    - üßµ Gutermann All-Purpose (MARA 100) Tex 30 polyester thread.

    2-ply Supplex makes great running or paddleboard shorts, but lighter colors like yellow tend to be a bit sheer. 4-ply is
    more durable and has a hand feel closer to the original Patagonia¬Æ Baggies‚Ñ¢. High res comparison of fabric textures can
    be seen in Detailed Build Photos üëáüèΩ

    Measured weight of shorts, all size medium by inseam and fabric type:

    - 7.5oz Patagonia Baggies 5" originals (4-ply Supplex)
    - 5.6oz black DIAS 7" (2-ply Supplex)
    - 4.9oz Patagonia Baggie Lights 6.5" (polyester)
    - 4.5oz blue DIAS 5" (Supplex Solarweave)
    - 3.5oz yellow DIAS 5" (2-ply Supplex)
