    - One zipper atleast Fabric Height <span class="patternHeight"/>.
    For more information on zippers, see [Zippers Guide.](/articles/zippers)
    - One fabric panel to match the pattern dimensions.

    There are tons of fabric options. Learn more about technical fabrics,
    recommendations, and trusted vendors in our new [Fabrics Guide](/fabrics).
    Here are a few recommendations.

    - Cordura 500d or 210d Robic Nylon are great choices for durable, self
      standing zip pouch.
    - HyperD 300 is water tight and comes in many bright colors. Example
      is Moroccan Blue.
    - 1.9oz PU Coated Nylon for lightweight, water resistant pouches with
      many color options.

  # Assembly Instructions

  <DividedSection header="Measure and Cut Fabric">
    <Image

      width={225}

      src={import("@/images/zipsack/zipInstr1.png")}
      alt="fabric"
      class="float-right rounded-lg"
    />

    1. Using the generated **Fabric Width <span class="patternWidth"/>**
      and **Fabric Height <span class="patternHeight"/>**, measure and draw the dimensions on a fabric panel.
    1. Cut the fabric panel along the outer perimeter.
    1. Mark the 1/2 inch (1.3 cm) zipper allowance along the Fabric Height
      edges.
    1. Mark the 3/8 inch (1 cm) seam allowance along the Fabric Width
      edges.

  <DividedSection header="Attach Zipper">

      src={import("@/images/zipsack/zipInstr2.png")}
      alt="fabric"
      class="float-right rounded-lg"
    />

    1. With the fabric panel wrong side facing up, align one edge of zipper
      tape to Fabric Height edge and sew within the 1/2 inch zipper
      allowance.
    1. Align the opposite zipper tape along the other Fabric Height edge
      and sew.
    1. Line up the Fabric Width edges and add the zipper pull.
    1. If using a closed end zipper, ensure Fabric Width edges align when
      sewing the opposite zipper tape.

    With the zipper closed, you should have a cylinder with fabric's wrong
    side out!

  <DividedSection header="Close Zip Pouch Ends">

      src={import("@/images/zipsack/zipInstr3.png")}
      alt="fabric"
      class="float-right rounded-lg"
    />

    1. With wrong sides out, close zipper and lay flat. Ensure zipper is
      parallel with edges. Zipper should be evenly spaced in the middle.
    1. Lining up the bottom edge, sew one end closed with the 3/8 inch (1
      cm) seam allowance. Being careful not to break your needle, sew over
      the zipper.
    1. Flip around, smooth out and ensure zipper is still parallel and
      evenly spaced. Sew opposite end with 3/8" (1 cm) seam allseam
      allseam allowance.
    1. If you have long zipper tape, don't make the rookie move and sew
      your zipper pull on the outside of the bag!
    1. Trim excess zipper tape off both ends.
    1. For bonus points, consider adding pull loops to the zipper ends.
      Grosgrain ribbon or excess zipper tape work great. Make sure your
      loops are sewn INSIDE the pouch!

    You should now have a flat zip pouch that you can open and close with
    the zipper. In the next step, we'll give it some volume.

  <DividedSection header="Square Up the Ends">

    />

    1. With wrong sides out, fold the sack so the zipper is pressed in half
      along the long edge. From an end, this creates the shape shown ->
    1. Take care to smooth out the corners so the ends are square and
      symmetric.
    1. Measure your desired width and height as shown. Again keep
      everything square and symmetric.
    1. Stitch two seams as shown along the dashed lines (5) and (6). Make
      sure your seams are perpendicular to the seam from the previous
      step.
    1. Repeat on the opposite end.
    1. Before trimming your corners, flip your sack right side out and
      ensure your zipper runs evenly down the middle of pouch.

    If everything went to plan, you can now trim your corners. To prevent
    fraying, take the time to bind your seams with bias tape or grosgrain
    ribbon.

    Congrats! You now have a functional zip pouch, hand made to your
    exact dimensions!
