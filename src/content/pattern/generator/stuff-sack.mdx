    Learn about technical fabrics, recommendations, and trusted vendors in our new <a href="article/fabrics">Fabrics Guide</a>.

    Lighter weight materials such as 1.9oz ripstop nylon work best for drawstring channels.

    - One fabric circle cut to size
    - One fabric rectangular panel cut to size
    - Drawstring ~6 inches (15 cm) longer than **<span class="patternWidth"/>**
    - One cord lock that works with your drawstring.

    />

    1. For the circle, cut a square piece of paper with each side slightly larger than the **<span class="patternDiameter"/> Diameter**.
    2. Fold this square in half and then in half again, along the other edge, making a smaller square.
    3. Mark the generated **<span class="patternRadius"/> Circle Radius**, from the fold corner to draw symmetric arc as shown.
    4. Cut and unfold your perfectly symmetric circle pattern.
    5. Trace and cut your fabric along the outer perimeter.
    6. Mark the 3/8 inch (1 cm) seam allowance along the inside edge.

      alt="Pattern"
      class="float-right rounded-lg"
    />

    1. Using the generated **<span class="patternWidth"/> Fabric Width** and
    **<span class="patternHeight"/> Fabric Height**, measure and draw the dimensions on a fabric panel.
    2. Cut the fabric panel along the outer perimeter.
    3. Mark the 1.5 inch (4 cm) channel allowance along one Fabric Width edge.
    4. Mark the 3/8 inch (1 cm) seam allowance along each remaining edge.

    You should now have two fabric panels, a circle and a body.

    />

    1. With wrong side up, fold the corners to the channel allowance, as shown. Pins or wash-away tape helps.
    2. Fold the top edge down to the channel allowance. In the illustration, the wrong side is light blue.
    3. If your presser foot is narrow enough, insert the drawstring and stitch along the channel edge.
    4. Optionally, stitch as close to the raw edge as possible and pull your drawstring thru later.
    5. Depending on how quickly your fabric frays, you may consider overcasting the raw edge with a zigzag stitch.

    Your channel should look like the illustration, quite loose around the drawstring.

  <DividedSection header="Sewing the Circle">
    <Image
      format="webp"
      width={225}
      aspectRatio="1/1"
      src={import("@/images/stuffsack/ssInstr4.png")}
      alt="Pattern"
      class="float-right rounded-lg"
    />

    1. Contrary to many online tutorials, it's better to sew the circle now to avoid puckering later.
    2. This is by far the toughest part of the project, so take your time. A short stitch length makes sewing curves
    easier.
    3. With right sides touching, align the circle's **center line** to the body's left edge seam allowance.
    4. The bottom of the circle should be touching the bottom edge of the body panel.
    5. If your diameter is large enough, pin or staple the body to the circle's perimeter within the seam allowance.
    6. Follow your circle's seam allowance as you sew. Go slow, use a short stitch length. Make sure the edges are even
    as you progress.
    7. As you reach your starting point, stop before stitching over the body panels vertical seam allowance.

    Phew, you're past the crux. Circles take a lot of patience and practice.

      class="float-right rounded-lg"
    />

    1. Because we stitched the circle first, the vertical seam allowances may be a bit uneven. No worries!
    2. Press your stuff sack flat against a table with the open seam along an edge.
    3. Start or stop at the red "x" drawn in the illustration.
    4. Either way, sew the body seam closed, reinforcing the channel opening.
    5. If your seams fray, consider edge binding or look into French Seams next time.
    6. Pull your drawstring through and add your cord lock!

    **üëè Congrats on making your own custom stuff sack!**

    Sewing round bottom stuff sacks is tougher than it appears huh?!
