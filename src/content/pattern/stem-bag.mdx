      1. Single fold 1/4 inch (6mm) to wrong side of fabric and hem one end of collar. Repeat other end.
      1. Fold collar in half along length, wrong sides together (WST) and finger press to crease.
      1. Starting ~1 inch (3cm) from either end, baste along long edge, sewing within the 3/8 inch (1cm) seam allowance.
      1. Label starting point edge with "B".
      1. Set aside cinch collar.

      1. Wrong sides out, align back panel to front panel along one side. Webbing daisy chain should align to the mesh pocket opening.
      1. Sew Back to Front using 3/8 inch (1 cm) seam allowance.
      1. Double check your front pocket and webbing are oriented correctly in relation to each other.

      1. Contrary to many online tutorials, it's better to sew the circle now to avoid puckering later.
      1. This is by far the toughest part of the project, so take your time. A short stitch length makes sewing curves easier.
      1. Tip: put Body panel below Bottom. Rotate circle as you sew, feeding Front-Back straight.
      1. With right sides touching, align Bottom panel to bottom edge of Body panel. Arrange the bottom panel's webbing parallel to the body's bottom edge.
      1. The edge of the circle should be touching the bottom edge of the body panel.
      1. Begin sewing, precisely following your 3/8 inch (1 cm) seam allowance as you sew.
      1. Go slow, use a short stitch length. Make sure the edges stay even as you progress.
      1. As you reach your starting point, stop short before stitching over the body panels vertical seam allowance.

      />

      1. Because we stitched the circle first, the vertical seam allowances may be a bit uneven. No worries!
      1. With clips or pins, align the Body Panels with the Bottom circle to close the gap.
      1. Adjust the Body panel seam allowances to match the remaining circumference of the bottom panel.
      1. Sew the vertical body seam closed.
      1. Last, stitch closed the gap remaining in bottom circle panel.

      Flip the body right side out to check for any puckering or misalignment. Can fix minor puckering by seam ripping a small area and pulling/easing any excess fabric.

      />

      1. With your bag body right side out, align the raw edge of collar along the top of body.
      1. Opposite end of collar slips into the open end of collar, marked "B", making a cord channel.
      1. Baste stitch a Cyberian Cord Loc into this seam, near the cord channel opening. The cord lock should be sandwiched between Body and Channel.
      1. Using 1/4 inch (6mm) seam allowance, stitch the collar to the body.

        alt="Lining body attached to lining bottom. Note gap in vertical seam."
      />

        1. Repeating above steps, sew the liner body to the liner bottom.
        2. Along the vertical seam, leave a 3" (8 cm) gap to be closed after flipping the bag.

        alt="Liner attached to body, flipped thru gap in vertical seam, and gap closed."
      />

      1. Slide assembled body inside the assembled liner. Right sides touching. Wrong side of liner should be out.
      2. Align and clip liner along top perimeter of body/collar.
      3. Sew along perimeter using 3/8 inch (1 cm) seam allowance.
      4. Flip entire bag right side out, passing Body thru gap in liner vertical seam.
      5. Top stitch liner closed. Then push liner into Body.

      Congrats, the sewing is complete!

        alt="Velcro attaches bag to handlebar and stem. Cord tied to fork stops swinging."
      />

      1. Cut velcro straps or One-Wrap to fit around handlebars and stem.
      2. Add draw cord thru channel and cord lock. Small shock cord works great as well.
      3. Tie cord thru the bottom panel webbing and around the bike fork to prevent swinging.

      Great job, now make another one for a matched pair!
